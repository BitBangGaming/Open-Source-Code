# Open Source Code
 
All of the code here is written by Bit Bang Gaming LLC. Like many companies, there are bits of code that is not proprietary and are obvious enough in the field for which it operates in. For example a PID control algorithm has been rolled so many ways at its basic level and in our opinion, doesn't make real sense to close source. Devices that are commissioned do not have their code exposed even if they are simple in nature.

For most of this code, there is associated hardware you can purchase from our online shop www.bitbanggaming.com to help you use the software more easily. For example, a lot of the code written is based on the WeAct Black Pill STM32 development board. You can easily take a look at the code and figure out which pins you need to wire to in order to make the code function as intended. We do not open source the hardware because this is a way we are able to make a profit (and for others as well to make a profit). This means if you want to support our company and/or would like use the intended hardware for testing before modifying the code for your own need or product, please purchase the hardware from our shop. If you want to use this code for your own product (free or commercial), or for any other use, you may do so but we take no responsibility for it. For details on this, please read the attached license.

If you want to have a technical discussion on the code, you are free to join our Discord and someone will reply to you in a reasonable amount of time: https://discord.gg/dNSgxEY
